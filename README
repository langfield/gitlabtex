If using Tampermonkey / Chrome, you may need to enable experimental instant
script injection to achieve this reliably - go to Tampermonkey Settings, Config
mode: Advanced, scroll to the bottom, set Experimental Inject Mode to Instant.

The file ``main.js`` is a tampermonkey script.

Install the tampermonkey chrome extension, add a new script, paste in
``main.js``, and set the settings as above.
